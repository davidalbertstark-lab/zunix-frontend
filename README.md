**Zunix – Frontend Practice Project**
**Overview**
Zunix is a frontend practice project built to strengthen my core skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It focuses on layout structure, responsiveness, visual balance, and clean UI implementation.
This project was created during my learning phase to move from theory into real, working interfaces.

**Purpose**
The goal of Zunix was not to build a full product, but to:
Practice translating designs into code
Improve layout and spacing intuition
Understand how components fit together visually
Build confidence working with raw frontend technologies (no frameworks)

**What This Project Demonstrates**
Solid understanding of HTML structure
Clean and readable CSS styling
Practical use of JavaScript for interaction
Attention to visual detail and user flow
Willingness to learn by building, not just watching tutorials

**Tech Stack**
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

**Status**
Completed as a learning project.
May be revisited later for refactoring or enhancement.

**Notes**
This repository represents an early stage in my development journey and serves as a foundation for more structured and system-level projects that follow.
